##CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Understanding

Some assignment solutions to CS224. a1 and a2 are from the 2016 offering of the class (cs224d) and a3 is from the 2017
offering (cs224n). Both offerings used TensorFlow implementations. 

Some key solutions:  
- Neural network basics implemented in numpy
- RNN Language Model
- Several models for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    - Window-based classifier model
    - Vanilla RNN model
    - GRU model
