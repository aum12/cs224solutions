## CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Understanding

Assignment solutions to Stanford CS224 course. a1 and a2 are from the 2016 offering of the class (cs224d) and a3 is from the 2017 offering (cs224n). Both classes used TensorFlow implementations. 

Some key solutions:  
- Neural network basics implemented in numpy
- RNN Language Model
- Several models for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    - Window-based classifier model
    - Vanilla RNN model
    - GRU model
